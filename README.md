# Sockit
Sockit provides a Lua-based firmware (using [NodeMCU](https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/))
and a simple [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)-based app for controlling a smart socket which is powered by an
[ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) microcontroller.

# Getting started
To get started with Sockit, you'll need a compatible smart plug / switch. Sockit was built with the
[Sonoff S20](https://www.itead.cc/smart-socket.html) in mind, but really any ESP8266-powered device should
work, but the pin definitons in [`lua/pins.lua`](lua/pins.lua) will need to be edited (and then the firmware
must be re-built).

## Flashing the firmware
You can grab the latest pre-built firmware (for the Sonoff S20) from the [releases page](../../releases).
Before flashing, you'll need to connect your device to your computer via a UART adapter (**3.3V logic or
your ESP8266 will be fried!**). [This page](https://esphome.io/devices/sonoff_s20.html#step-2-connecting-uart)
does a good job explaining how to open up a Sonoff S20 and connect up a UART adapter.

Once connected, you'll need [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool), or some other ESP8266 flashing
tool. Then you can run the following command:

```bash
esptool write_flash --erase-all --flash-mode dout 0 /path/to/sockit-esp8266.bin
```

Note:
 - `esptool` may need to be run as root
 - It might be necessary to specify the serial port with `-p`
 - `--flash-mode` will depend on your ESP8266, but for Sonoffs this is generally `DOUT`

## App installation
You can get a pre-built version of the app from the Play Store - it costs â‚¬1.99 (or your regional equivalent).
The Play Store version is built directly from this code (and no binaries are provided in this repo). Think of
buying the app from the store as a "donation"!

If you want to build the app yourself, that's as easy as installing
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and running `flutter build` in the `app/` directory.

### iOS?
In theory, since the app was written with Flutter (with no Android-specific parts), it should work without
any changes on iOS (aside from adding graphics / metadata to the stub native app). However, since I don't own
a Mac or iOS device (and don't have the $99 developer license from Apple), this is currently not a priority.

Feel free to try and build the app on your own iOS device!

# Firmware development
## Building the firmware
If you want to build the firmware from source (e.g. if you want to change the pin definitions for use with a
device other than the Sonoff S20), follow these instructions.

1. Clone this repo and run `git submodule update --init --recursive` - this will download the NodeMCU code
2. Install [SRecord](http://srecord.sourceforge.net/) - necessary for producing the final one-binary firmware
3. Run `scripts/apply_firmware_config.sh` to apply build-time configuration (this should only be done once)
4. Run `scripts/build.sh` to build the firmware

Once built, a flashable firmware will be available at `firmware/bin/sockit-esp8266.bin`

## Making changes
If you're making changes to the firmware (either Lua code or build configuration, it's possible that the LFS
addresses (defined in [`scripts/lfs_info.sh`](scripts/lfs_info.sh)) will change. In order to calculate these
values, build the firmware without embedding the LFS image by running `scripts/build.sh no_lfs`. After flashing
this firmware, follow the instructions from
[here](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/master/lua_examples/lfs/lfs_fragments.lua) to obtain
updated values for the variables in `scripts/lfs_info.sh`.

## Faster development
If you're making lots of changes to the Lua code, it can be annoying to have to re-build, erase and flash the
whole firmware each time. Instead of doing this, you can flash the full firmware once and run
`scripts/lfs_flash.sh` each time you make a change. This will recompile the LFS image and flash it over the
correct area on the chip in one go. You might want to tweak the `esptool` command in this script based on your
setup.
